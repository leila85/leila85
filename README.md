      Hi, Iâ€™m @leila85, I'm quite new in Github! My account is opened since a while but I've never user. 
      I would use to upload all the code I've been writing since march 2021 (practical exercises from books, hackerrank, codewars, edx courses, ...)
- ðŸ‘€ 
      Iâ€™m interested in drawing, comics, videogames and ofcourse programming.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++ and I would enhance my C skills ^.^
